\title{Run script with optional debugging}
\description{
Run an "R script" either from a file (\code{msource}) or directly from a character vector (\code{mrun}). The main point is to allow "automated" debugging with \code{\link{mtrace}}, controlled via the \code{debug} argument. This defaults to TRUE for \code{msource} (where you could just use \code{source} instead if you didn't want to debug), but to FALSE for \code{mrun} (which is useful in its own right without debugging, in which case it amounts just to \code{eval( parse( text=...))}). Evaluation by default takes place in \code{.GlobalEnv}, so objects created are permanent.

I use \code{mrun} because, although scripts (as opposed to "pure functions") can be quite useful, I don't like separate script files--- too many Things to keep track of. Also, debugging "scripts" is normally painful compared to debugging functions, for which \code{\link{mtrace}} makes life easy. My "scripts" are created with \code{fixtext} as opposed to \code{fixr}, and are character vectors of S3 class \code{cat}, which means they display nicely; I give them names ending ".r", so that they are obvious.

The debugging trick behind all this is to make the "script" into the body of an \code{mlocal} function--- which is thereby debuggable--- then forcing it to execute directly in the \code{local} environment. The "frame number" when debugging--- ie "xxx" inside the "D(xxx)>" prompt--- will be 0 for the default \code{local=.GlobalEnv}, or some unpredictable number for a bespoke environment.

\usage{
mrun( script, local=FALSE, debug=FALSE, echo=TRUE, print.eval=FALSE, ...)
msource( file, local=FALSE, debug=TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ script}{Character vector of R{} commands}
\item{ local}{FALSE for \code{.GlobalEnv}, TRUE for frame where \code{msource} / \code{mrun} is called, or an environment (or something that can be coerced to an environment)}
\item{ debug}{set to TRUE if you want to use the \pkg{debug} package}
\item{ file}{filename of R{} "script"}
\item{ echo, print.eval, ...}{['mrun'] as per \code{source}, and ignored unless \code{debug=FALSE}.}
\item{ ...}{['msource'] only for \code{debug=FALSE}, in which case passed direct to \code{source}.}
}
\value{Whatever the last expression gave, invisibly.

\examples{
scriptio.r <- c( 'a <- 99', 'b <- a+1')
mrun( scriptio.r)
a # 99; created in .GlobalEnv
b # 100
